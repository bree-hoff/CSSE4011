# KPIs
* Latency - Ultrasonic Sensors: Measures the time taken for the ultrasonic sensors to detect movement, for a sampling rate > 2kHz.
* Latency - Camera: Measures the time taken for camera to detect a gesture.
* Latency - GUI: Measures the time taken for inputs to appear on the GUI, and for HID packets to be displayed in-game.
* Accuracy: Liklihood of detecting a gesture/movement correctly. Methods of unsupervised learning may be employed and assessed in accordance with this KPI.
* Reliability: AI detection of gestures in different lighting conditions, high-activity areas, and different subjects (i.e., environmental robustness).
* Display: Should produce a timely display of various actions on the Minecraft interface, as well as the GUI.
* User Experience: Measures the user's satisfaction with the game and its interface.
